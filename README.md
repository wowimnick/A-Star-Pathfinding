# A-Star-Pathfinding
Path finding using the A* Algorithm 

A* Pathfinding Algorithm that i made for fun, you can draw the starting point, ending point, and walls that it will try to navigate around.

You can change the amount of rows that will be in the grid, try to keep it below 200 as going over will cause issues or the program will crash. The higher you go the slower the algorithm will run.

Pygame is the only requirement for running it.
